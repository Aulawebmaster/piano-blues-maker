I-I-I-I<br/>
IV-IV-I-I<br/>
V-IV-I-V<br/>

Cuttently only this type of blues progression is supported.

A typical blues consists of several progressions and you can add them as many as you want. For each you can set right and left hand patterns independently. Optionally, you can specify blues intro end ending.
